<p>Although you may not readily approve of my aching heartfor you
My dreams,my feelings, my longings for you softly bloom like a flower so true
Although youare the only one who knowsthe nameless shadow that is me
It’s enough for me to go through another day enough for me to be
Let me whisper to you all those precious moments beneath the sweet and warm, bright moon
That you call upon me to summon through the tears that were forgotten all too soon
Your lovelysmile, keeps memoving on I”ll remember all the times we shared<br>
I’ll cherish <a href="http://www.naver.com" target="_blank"

<img src="타마마.jfif" alt="타마마" width="180px">
<p style="margin-top: 35px;">Your lovely smile, keeps me hanging on I'll ne're forget that we truely care
I’ll treasure your smile though we’ll never be man and wife
Although our hopes and fantasies may never happenin our time
The dreams we shared through the good and the bad will be in our hearts for all moments to Come
My soft silent prayers seekto reach and touch you in the midst of the darkest night
Holding back my tears burning for your heart with the smallest hopes in the light</p>
